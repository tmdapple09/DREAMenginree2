 *
 * Persistent Collaborative Realities — core type definitions.
 *
 * A Reality is a named, persistent shared space composed of multiple
 * synchronized Engins. Unlike an ephemeral SharedDream session (which
 * dies when all users disconnect), a Reality has:
 *
 *   • Identity    — a stable ID, name, and creator across all time
 *   • Continuity  — DB-backed state snapshots that survive disconnects
 *   • Composition — multiple Engins can be active simultaneously
 *   • Activity    — a persistent timeline of what happened and who was there
 *   • Membership  — users can be members with roles, even when offline
 *
 * Architecture: lib/ Logic layer per GENERATION_LAW §3.1.
 * Security: AXIOM 4 — RLS enforced server-side, user_id filters client-side.
 * Privacy: AXIOM 5 — activity timeline is scoped to members only.
