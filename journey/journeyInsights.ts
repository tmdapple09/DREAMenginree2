 * Derived signal layer for the Journey Trail.
 *
 * "You need computed layers: Streaks · First-time actions · Repeated behaviors · Drop-offs.
 *  Not just dots → patterns." — DREAMengin product directive
 *
 * All functions are pure — no I/O, no React, no DOM.
 * Designed for use in JourneyTrail.tsx and future analytics surfaces.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *   "first occurrence" — the single earliest dot of a given kind in the trail.
 *   "streak"          — consecutive calendar days with at least one dot.
 *   "frequency"       — count of dots of a given kind within a rolling window.
 *   "return gap"      — a gap of ≥ GAP_DAYS between two consecutive dots
 *                       on the same surface, flagging the later one as a return.
