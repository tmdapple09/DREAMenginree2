# GameEngin Brain — File-Based Knowledge Substrate

Authoritative source: [`GameENGINspec.md`](../../../GameENGINspec.md) §2.

The Brain is a version-controlled directory that is the **single source of truth**
for game-design knowledge, inspiration, and originality tracking used by the
autonomous studio agents (Maestro, Prophet, Artisan, Mechanic, Writer, Tech
Director).
