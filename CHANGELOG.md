## [Unreleased]

### Added — DreamDM Bar UX, tap discipline, solo-parity scaffolds (2026-04-20)

- **Whole bar is the drag handle.** Pointer drag handlers in
  `dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx` moved off the small light wrapper
  onto the bar root so the entire surface can be grabbed (touch already had
  this; divider mode preserved).
- **Momentum fling restored.** New `decideBarRelease` helper in
  `dreamdmbar/runtime/barInteractions.ts` returns `'snap-top' | 'snap-bottom' | 'park'`.
  Slow drag → bar parks wherever the user lets go (no forced snap-back);
  upward fling past the invisible 2/5 line (`BAR_FLING_LINE_RATIO = 0.4`) →
  snaps to top; downward fling at/below the line → snaps to bottom.
- **System-wide single-tap discipline.** New `hooks/useTap.ts` exposes
  `useTap` (canonical single-tap) and `useHomeParticleTap` (the sole
  sanctioned double-tap site, gold particle only). `ForgeDreamCanvas`
  add-piece converted from `onDoubleClick` to `onClick`. Game-controller and
  sprint-detector double-taps are gameplay primitives inside cartridges and
  intentionally kept. New ESLint guardrail in `eslint.config.mjs`
  (`no-restricted-syntax`) warns on any `onDoubleClick` / `onDblClick` JSX
  attribute outside `hooks/useTap.ts` and the cartridge directories
  (`components/games/**`, `engins/gameengin/games/**`, `engine/dualsense/**`).
- **Solo-parity runtime channel.** `engine/runtime/runtimeChannel.ts` adds
  `LocalChannel` (in-mem pub/sub, faulty-listener-isolated), `RealtimeChannel`
  (lazy Supabase import with graceful local fallback), and a
  `createRuntimeChannel(id, mode)` factory. Solo == co-op with one peer; the
  React tree never branches on mode.
- **Manifest schema.** `DaydreamEnginManifest` gained optional `solo: boolean`
  and `coop: boolean | { affordances: string[] }` (backwards-compatible).
- **Roadmap.** `COOP_AND_SOLO_ROADMAP.md` at the repo root captures the
  eleven decisions taken on the user's behalf and the per-pass execution
  checklist for follow-on PRs (universal editor, multi-instance manager,
  universal drag/drop, consent flow, co-op pack starting with
  `StarMakerEngin`).
- **Tests.** `tests/decide-bar-release.test.ts` (6) and
  `tests/runtime-channel.test.ts` (5) added. Existing
  `tests/dreamdm-bar-interactions.test.ts` continues to pass.

### Changed

- **SICC principle update** — "Stylized" replaced with "Synchronized" in the SICC framework.
  The new SICC stands for: **Synchronized**, Intuitive, Coherent, Cohesive.
  *Synchronized* emphasizes real-time coordination across runtimes, shared state, collaborative
  actions, and immediate feedback — replacing the prior focus on visual decoration.
  See `docs/PRINCIPLES_UPDATE.md` for full rationale.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-25

**"One Product"** — DREAMengin v2.0.0 closes all multi-generation structural partials and ships as a single coherent runtime environment.

### What v2.0.0 means

1. **Canonical naming wins** — Every surface, route, component, and doc now uses the single authority defined in `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts` and `docs/NAMING_AUTHORITY.md`. Widget-era naming is fully archived. Dream Window is the only term for modular runtime containers.

2. **HomeDream is the clear product center** — `/homedream` is the authenticated runtime root. All competing shell routes (`/dreamengin`, etc.) now redirect to `/homedream`. Gold Button + DreamDM Bar + dual runtime persistence make the hierarchy obvious.

3. **Parallel old/new UI layers stop competing** — `components/v1-ui/` is archived. Competing Babylon orbit shell (`/dreamengin`) is redirected. `components/DashboardLayout*`, `NavBar*`, `HomeDashboard` all carry archive headers. v1-era CSS subordinated.

4. **Dreams / Daydreams / Engins are legible** — `/codespace` → `/daydream/code`. `/physics-lab` → `/daydream/lab`. `/music` routing fixed in DreamDMBar. Surface names in HomeDream quick-actions corrected to canonical terms.

5. **Auth + onboarding + entry are boring and reliable** — New users from `/join` go to `/onboarding` (not directly to `/homedream`). OAuth from `/join` sets `?next=/onboarding` on the auth callback. Returning users go straight to `/homedream`.

6. **Core repo partials closed** — Build enforcement (`engine/agents/adari.ts`, `scripts/postbuild.js`) updated from v1-era files to v2.0.0 canonical required files. DreamDMBar routing fully aligned to canonical Daydream routes. `PRODUCT_VERSION = '2.0.0'` in canonical-names.

### Changed

- `package.json` — version `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`
- `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts` — added `PRODUCT_VERSION = '2.0.0'` constant
- `app/layout.tsx` — removed global `@/components/v1-ui/widget-feed-screen.css` import
- `components/home/dream.HomeDream.tsx` — removed v1-ui CSS import; renamed `widget-rail` → `dream-rail`, `widget-icon` → `dream-rail-icon`, `feed-area-transition` → `dream-feed-transition`; aria-labels updated
- `styles/home-dream.css` — added v2 Dream Rail CSS classes
- `app/dreamengin/page.tsx` — was Babylon orbit shell; now `redirect('/homedream')`
- `app/codespace/page.tsx` — was CodeSpace IDE; now `redirect('/daydream/code')`
- `app/physics-lab/page.tsx` — was PhysicsLab; now `redirect('/daydream/lab')`
- `app/join/page.tsx` — email signup redirects to `/onboarding`; OAuth sets `?next=/onboarding` on callback
- `dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx` — `dreams` surface routes to `toggleDrEams()` (not `/dreamengin`); `code` → `/daydream/code`; `music` → `/daydream/music`
- `components/home/dream.WorkspaceDashboard.tsx` — quick-action pills: "DreamProfile" → "Edit ProfileDream", "Feed" → "Discover", "Your Dreams" → "View Profile"
- `engine/agents/adari.ts` — REQUIRED_PATHS updated to v2 canonical files; version check added
- `scripts/postbuild.js` — same
- `docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md` — all partial items closed; v2.0.0 checklist added
- `tests/v2-readiness.test.ts` — 31 structural invariant tests

### Archived (preserved for reference, archive header added)

- `components/DashboardLayout.tsx`, `DashboardLayout-enhanced.tsx`
- `components/NavBar.tsx`, `NavBar-enhanced.tsx`
- `components/HomeDashboard.tsx`
- `components/MobileFeedCard.tsx`, `MobileNavBarEnhanced.tsx`
- `components/dream.FeedCard-enhanced.tsx`
- `components/dream.AIAssistant-voice-enhanced.tsx`, `AIAssistantEnhanced.tsx`
- `components/CollaborativeCanvas.tsx`, `ContentScheduler.tsx`
- `components/v1-ui/` — CSS no longer globally imported
