/**
 * lib/games/useAIDirector.ts
 *
 * React hook wrapping the `AIDirector` class so any game component can plug
 * in adaptive difficulty with a single import.
 *
 * The `AIDirector` (lib/gameengin/ai-director.ts) is an in-browser TensorFlow.js
 * powered system that maps player signals → a normalized challenge level (0–1).
 * Previously it was only wired manually in NeonDrift and EchoArena — this hook
 * makes it trivially composable in any game.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   const { update, level, state, ready } = useAIDirector();
 *
 *   // Inside game loop (e.g. every N frames):
 *   const directorState = update({ deaths, score, combo, avgSpeed, elapsed });
 *   const spawnRate = BASE_SPAWN_RATE * (0.5 + directorState.challengeLevel);
 *
 * The hook:
 *   1. Creates an `AIDirector` instance (stable across renders via ref).
 *   2. Calls `director.init()` once on mount — loads TF.js + warms up the backend.
 *   3. Exposes a stable `update` callback and reactive `level` / `state` values.
