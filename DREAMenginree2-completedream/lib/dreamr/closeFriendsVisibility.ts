 * Pure helpers for applying the DreamR close-friends visibility rule on

 *
 * Schema (see supabase/migrations/20260405000001_dreamr_feed_registry.sql):
 *   • app_posts.post_visibility  text DEFAULT 'public'
 *       — 'public'         : visible to everyone in feeds
 *       — 'close_friends'  : visible only to people on the poster's
 *                            close-friends list, plus the poster themselves
 *   • close_friends(user_id, friend_id)
 *       — user_id has friend_id in their close-friends list. RLS allows
 *         the *owner* of the list to read it. To filter the feed for an
 *         arbitrary viewer we need the inverse (which posters have THIS
 *         viewer on their list). That requires the service role.
