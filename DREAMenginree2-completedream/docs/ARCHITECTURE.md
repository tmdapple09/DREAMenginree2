Status: active implementation architecture  
Last updated: 2026-03-16

`README.md` is the authoritative full product specification. This file explains how the current repo maps to that spec and where the implementation is already strong versus where it is still being aligned.

## 0. DreamR-first architectural commandment

Start with **DreamR**.

DreamR is the first repo-level reference for the global build pattern:
- a **stable core** owns runtime state, event flow, visibility boundaries, safety rules, and durable execution contracts
- a **surface layer** renders the active user experience around that core
- a **rule-set layer** owns scoring, transforms, presets, thresholds, and domain variation

Reference split in the repo:
- `dreamdmbar/homedream/dreamr/dream.DreamRCore.tsx` — logic reactor / durable core seam
- `dreamdmbar/homedream/dreamr/dream.DreamRFeed.tsx` — active feed surface
- `dreamdmbar/homedream/dreamr/algorithms/dreamrAlgorithm.ts` — swappable ranking rule-set

This commandment is global. New systems should add behavior by composing or replacing
rule-sets before rewriting the core layer. If a feature needs a one-off core branch,
the boundary is wrong and should be redesigned.

## 1. Product model

DREAMengin is a **privacy-first, DreamDM-Bar-led spatial operating environment** built around three core surfaces, a six-surface Daydream network connected to six Engin runtimes via 11 named connection paths, Dream Windows, and the AI triad.

### Runtime structure

```
DreamDM Bar  ── root container (owns both runtimes)
├── HomeDream Surface  ── dependent runtime, lives above the bar
└── DreamSpace          ── dependent runtime, lives below the bar
```

- **DreamDM Bar** — root container. Not a component of either runtime; it owns both. When the bar moves, both runtimes are pushed with it. When the bar is hidden, both runtimes remain rendered at the split they held.
- **HomeDream Surface** — first dependent runtime / root private operating surface with the feed
- **DreamSpace** — second dependent runtime owned by the DreamDM Bar; always rendered, frozen at the last split when the bar is hidden

### Core surfaces
- **HomeDream Surface** — the main private operating surface (`/homedream`)
- **Edit ProfileDream Surface** — the private builder for profile output (`/edit-profiledream`)
- **View Profile Surface** — the shared/public output surface (`/view-profile`)

### README §5 — Global Product Architecture

The product has two major surface groups:

- **Core Dreams (not Daydreams):** HomeDream, Edit ProfileDream, View Profile.
- **Daydream Pair model:** each Daydream has Side A (domain experience) and Side B (its Engin control layer).

Naming rule: only Side B uses the `Engin` suffix.

### Daydream Surface Network (multi-connection, not 1-to-1)
- Music Daydream Surface / StarMakerEngin
- Games Daydream Surface / GameEngin
- Lab Daydream Surface / LabEngin
- Code Daydream Surface / CodeEngin
- Brand Daydream Surface / BrandingEngin
- Create Daydream Surface / ContentEngin

Any Daydream Surface may connect to multiple Engin runtimes. The system is a multi-surface, multi-engin connection network with 11 named connection paths.

### Platform modules
- Dream Windows (modular runtime containers)
- DreamShop Surface
- DreamMarketplace Surface
- DreamMenu
- DreamDM Surface
- DreamAds Surface

### AI triad
- Dr. Eams
- IDARi
- TheBoogieMan.Ai

## 2. Canonical route model in the repo

| Product surface | Canonical route | Current support routes |
|---|---|---|
| HomeDream Surface | `/homedream` | `/home` |
| Edit ProfileDream Surface | `/edit-profiledream` | `/edit-profile` |
| View Profile Surface | `/view-profile` | `/profile/[handle]`, `/profile`, `/u/[handle]` |
| DreamShop Surface | `/shop` | `/shop/sell` |
| DreamMarketplace Surface | `/marketplace` | none |
| DreamDM Surface | `/messages` | none |
| DreamAds Surface | `/ads` | `/ads/create` |

The canonical product names should be used in docs, labels, and architecture conversations even when support routes still exist.

## 3. Current implementation zones

### HomeDream Surface
Primary code lives in:
- `app/homedream/page.tsx`
- `app/home/page.tsx`
- `components/home/*`
- `components/dreamnav/*`
- `components/menus/*`
- `components/dream.HomeRadialNav.tsx`
- `dreamdmbar/homedream/dreamr/*` for the DreamR-first feed/core split that future surfaces should emulate

### Edit ProfileDream Surface and View Profile Surface
Primary code lives in:
- `app/edit-profiledream/page.tsx`
- `app/edit-profile/page.tsx`
- `app/view-profile/page.tsx`
- `app/profile/[handle]/page.tsx`
- `components/profile/*`
- `components/dream.ProfileEditor.tsx`

### Dream Windows
Canonical Dream Window layer files already exist in:
- `components/dreams/dreamsurface.shell.tsx`
- `components/dreams/dream.connectorlayer.tsx`
- `components/dreams/dream.featurelayer.tsx`
- `components/dreams/dream.outputlayer.tsx`
- `components/dreams/dream.widget.SuperDreamWidget.tsx`

Legacy widget implementation material still exists in:
- `components/widgets/*`
- `types/widget-system-v2.ts`

## 4. Universal Dream Window model

The repo is being aligned to one universal Dream Window model.

### Layer 1 — DreamShell
Visual shell, naming, size, placement, style, menus, and shell-level controls.

### Layer 2 — Connector / Identity
Authentication state, provider identity, capability discovery, and connector metadata.

### Layer 3 — Feature
Active modules that only appear when the connector or Dream Window actually supports them.

### Layer 4 — Output / Projection
Saved profile-safe output. This is what should be shared into View Profile Surface and other public contexts.

## 5. Privacy and projection boundaries

The architecture follows the README rule that nothing is public by default.

- **HomeDream Surface** is the private source surface.
- **Edit ProfileDream Surface** is the private builder and staging layer.
- **View Profile Surface** and public profile routes must render only saved/shared output.
- Profile output must not read unrestricted private HomeDream data.
- Any visibility change with public effect must require explicit user intent.

## 6. Combined profile output

Compatible Dream Windows may combine into automatic profile output blocks.

Implementation rule:
- the user chooses what to expose
- the system decides the default composition template
- the public/shared surface receives a projection, not the source Dream Window internals

## 7. DreamAds separation

DREAMengin uses two distinct advertising concepts:

- **DreamAds** = user-controlled ad space or promotion slots attached to their surfaces where allowed
- **Platform promotions** = platform-run promotional inventory

These must remain separate in docs and code language.

## 8. Design system direction

The repo design language should use the README palette and intent model:
- **Gold** = save, confirm, action, premium emphasis
- **Light Blue** = live state, connected state, signal state
- **White** = base surface, clarity, space

Minimal clutter, intentional motion, mobile-first polish.

## 9. Current alignment gaps

These remain open and should be documented honestly:
- legacy route names still exist beside canonical spec routes
- legacy widget naming still appears in code and docs (use Dream Window canonically)
- extra daydream routes still exist outside the six canonical pairs
- some profile editing behavior still uses owner-facing profile workspace patterns rather than fully isolated Edit ProfileDream Surface language

## 10. Build/runtime assumptions

- Next.js 16+
- App Router
- TypeScript
- Node 25
- pnpm 10.30.0
- Supabase for auth, database, storage, and realtime

These assumptions should remain stable unless a change is truly required.

## 11. AI Rate-Limiting System

All AI API routes use a **single, unified rate-limit system**. There must be no deviation from this in future builds.

| Component | Canonical name |
|-----------|---------------|
| Supabase RPC | `check_ai_rate_limit` |
| Supabase table | `ai_rate_limits` |

**Removed / must not be used:**
- RPC `rate_limit_hit` — replaced by `check_ai_rate_limit`
- Table `rate_limit_counters` — replaced by `ai_rate_limits`

The TypeScript entry-point is `lib/ai/rateLimit.ts`:
- `checkRateLimit(userId, endpoint, limit, windowSeconds)` → `RateLimitResult`
- `getCurrentRPM(userId, endpoint)` → `number`

`RateLimitResult` interface:
```ts
{ allowed: boolean; rpm: number; retry_after_seconds?: number }
```

`checkRateLimit` is fail-closed: any RPC error or invalid response returns
`{ allowed: false, rpm: 0, retry_after_seconds }`.

The `lib/ai/rate-limiter.ts` file is a separate higher-level service that also
uses `check_ai_rate_limit` + `ai_rate_limits` and is not a replacement for
`rateLimit.ts` — both must stay consistent with the canonical table/RPC above.

## 12. Runtime Memory Architecture (SharedArrayBuffer + EnginDispatcher)

The Engine uses a **zero-copy shared memory model** powered by `SharedArrayBuffer` to
keep the HomeDream-rooted primary experience and the DreamDM-Bar-owned DreamSpace layer in sync without main-thread round-trips.

`lib/runtime/memory.ts` defines **two distinct SharedArrayBuffer layouts** that serve different roles:

---

### EnginSAB — shader worker buffer (`createEnginSAB()`)

Used by `EnginDispatcher` and the shader workers. Allocated at runtime via
`createEnginSAB()` and partitioned across all shader workers as non-overlapping
`Workgroup` slices. Total size: **`SAB_BYTES = 250,520` bytes (~245 KB)**.

| Region | Offset | Size | Purpose |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| PosX SoA | 0 – 39,999 | 40 KB | Float32 x-positions for 10,000 entities |
| PosY SoA | 40,000 – 79,999 | 40 KB | Float32 y-positions for 10,000 entities |
| PosZ SoA | 80,000 – 119,999 | 40 KB | Float32 z-positions for 10,000 entities |
| VelX SoA | 120,000 – 159,999 | 40 KB | Float32 x-velocities for 10,000 entities |
| VelY SoA | 160,000 – 199,999 | 40 KB | Float32 y-velocities for 10,000 entities |
| VelZ SoA | 200,000 – 239,999 | 40 KB | Float32 z-velocities for 10,000 entities |
| DaydreamType | 240,000 – 249,999 | 10 KB | Uint8 daydream-class identifier per entity |
| DreamDM Bar Y | 250,000 – 250,003 | 4 B | Float32 bar y-offset (root container y-position) |
| Telemetry | 250,008 – 250,519 | 512 B | Float64 µs/tick per worker (64 slots, 8-byte aligned) |

Key layout constants: `OFFSET_POS_X`, `OFFSET_POS_Y`, `OFFSET_POS_Z`, `OFFSET_VEL_X`,
`OFFSET_VEL_Y`, `OFFSET_VEL_Z`, `OFFSET_DAYDREAM_TYPE`, `OFFSET_DREAMDM_BAR_Y`,
`OFFSET_TELEMETRY`, `SAB_BYTES`.

---

### ConformMemoryMap — surface-sync buffer (`getConformMemoryMap()`)

Used to keep the HomeDream-rooted Surface Space and the DreamDM-Bar-owned DreamSpace in
sync via Atomics without main-thread round-trips. Allocated once as a singleton via
`getConformMemoryMap()`. Total size: **16 MB (`MEMORY_SIZE = 16,777,216` bytes)**.

| Region | Offset | Size | Purpose |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Control | 0 – 63 | 64 B | Atomics flags; `BAR_SEAM_ATOMICS_INDEX` (slot 0) — DreamDM Bar root container split ratio × 1000 |
| PosX SoA | 64 – 40,063 | ~39 KB | Float32 x-positions for 10,000 entities |
| PosY SoA | 40,064 – 80,063 | ~39 KB | Float32 y-positions for 10,000 entities |
| VelX SoA | 80,064 – 120,063 | ~39 KB | Float32 x-velocities for 10,000 entities |
| VelY SoA | 120,064 – 160,063 | ~39 KB | Float32 y-velocities for 10,000 entities |
| HomeDream private | 160,064 – end | ~16 MB | Private region — access enforced by `boogieMemoryGuard()` |

**Privacy boundary:** `PUBLIC_VIEW_LIMIT` prevents the public View Profile pointer from
ever reaching the HomeDream private region. `boogieMemoryGuard()` enforces rule
`C29_PRIVACY` (see `docs/BOOGIEMAN_POLICY.md`).

Use `writeBarSeam(splitRatio)` / `readBarSeam()` to write and read the DreamDM Bar split
ratio atomically via `Atomics.store()` / `Atomics.load()`.

---

### EnginDispatcher (`lib/runtime/EnginDispatcher.ts`)

`EnginDispatcher` is the process-wide singleton that orchestrates the shader worker pool:

1. Allocates the EnginSAB via `createEnginSAB()`.
2. Spawns `navigator.hardwareConcurrency − 1` shader workers (min 1, max `MAX_WORKERS`).
3. Partitions 10,000 entities into non-overlapping `Workgroup` slices and posts each
   worker its SAB + range via `postMessage` (zero-copy transfer).
4. Relays DreamDM Bar y-offset writes from the primary surface into the SAB so workers can
   reposition Dream Windows in DreamSpace without a main-thread round-trip.
5. Exposes per-worker µs/tick telemetry read directly from the SAB Telemetry Zone.
6. Enforces the IDARi/TheBoogieMan audit: any `bounds_violation` message from a worker
   is logged with full context and increments the violation counter.
7. Optionally loads and initialises the AssemblyScript Wasm physics engine
   (`engin-shader.wasm`) for near-native SIMD performance via `initWasm()`.

**SSR safety:** all browser-only APIs (`Worker`, `navigator`, `SharedArrayBuffer`) are
guarded behind `typeof` checks so this module is safe to import server-side.

**Usage:**
```ts
const dispatcher = EnginDispatcher.getInstance();
dispatcher.init();                        // allocate EnginSAB, spawn workers
await dispatcher.initWasm();              // optional: load Wasm SIMD physics engine
dispatcher.setDreamDMBarY(barYpx);        // relay bar seam position to workers
const stats = dispatcher.stats;           // { workerCount, microsecondsPerTick[], boundsViolations }
dispatcher.dispose();                     // terminate workers, release SAB
```

**Shader worker:** `public/workers/engin-shader.worker.ts` — each worker receives its
`Workgroup` slice and runs a `requestAnimationFrame` loop (with a `setTimeout` fallback
for non-browser contexts) so the main thread is never blocked by physics ticks.
