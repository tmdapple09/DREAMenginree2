# Gold Button Attachment & Dual Runtime System

> **Documentation Owner:** José Mancilla (appthemanger-ctrl)  
> **Documentation Date:** 2026-04-06


## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the corrected Gold Button attachment behavior and the new dual runtime system in DREAMengin.

## Gold Button Attachment Rule (CORRECTED SPEC)

### Summary

The Gold button is attached to the TOP of the DreamDM Bar by default and detaches ONLY when that attached position would go off the top of the screen, at which point it locks to the screen viewport.

### Detailed Behavior

1. **Default Attachment**
   - The Gold button is attached to the TOP of the DreamDM Bar
   - It stays attached while the bar is visible and on screen
   - The button's center sits on the bar's top edge

2. **Detachment Trigger**
   - The button detaches ONLY when dragging the bar upward causes the button's normal attached position to go off the top of the screen
   - It does NOT detach for typing
   - It does NOT detach for keyboard input
   - It does NOT detach for compose state
   - It does NOT detach for any other reason except position going off-screen

3. **Screen-Locked Mode**
   - When the attached position would go off-screen, the Gold button locks to the SCREEN/viewport
   - It positions itself at the top of the viewport (10px from top)
   - It does NOT move with page scroll
   - It does NOT move with feed scroll
   - It does NOT move with DreamSpace scroll
   - It does NOT move with widget scroll
   - Position is `fixed` relative to viewport, not the bar

4. **Reattachment**
   - When the bar is dragged back down and the top-of-box position is back on screen
   - The Gold button unlocks from the screen
   - It reattaches to the TOP of the DreamDM Bar

5. **Visual Indicator**
   - When screen-locked, the button has an extra glow effect in the box-shadow
   - This provides visual feedback that the button is in a different mode

### Implementation Details

**File:** `dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx`

```typescript
// Gold button geometry - CORRECTED PER SPEC
const attachedGoldTop: number = barTop - GOLD_R; // Normal attached position
const isGoldOffScreen: boolean = attachedGoldTop < 0; // Would it be off-screen?
const goldTopPx: number = isGoldOffScreen
  ? 10                                 // Screen-locked at top
  : attachedGoldTop;                   // Attached to bar top edge

const isScreenLocked: boolean = isGoldOffScreen;
```

The button always uses `position: fixed` to ensure it never moves with scroll when screen-locked.

## Dual Runtime System

### Overview

The system now supports two independent runtime views:
- **Top Runtime** - The primary view
- **Bottom Runtime** - The secondary view

These runtimes are NOT locked to specific content types. Both can display any world simultaneously.

### Valid Runtime States

The following combinations are all valid and supported:

| Top Runtime | Bottom Runtime | Description |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Home | Home | Two Home views, each scrolls independently |
| DreamSpace | DreamSpace | Two DreamSpace views, independent browsing |
| Home | DreamSpace | Traditional default configuration |
| DreamSpace | Home | Swapped configuration |
| Profile | Home | Profile on top, Home on bottom |
| Dream | Dream | Two instances of the same Dream |

**Key Insight:** The system does NOT restrict runtimes to be different. Users can have two Homes, two DreamSpaces, or any combination.

### Runtime Worlds

A `RuntimeWorld` can be:
- `'home'` - Home feed
- `'dreamspace'` - DreamSpace navigator
- `'profile'` - User profile
- `{ type: 'dream', id: string }` - A specific Dream
- `{ type: 'engin', name: string }` - A specific Engin
- `{ type: 'custom', path: string }` - Custom world

### Architecture

**Core Library:** `lib/runtime/dualRuntime.ts`

Defines types and utility functions:
```typescript
export interface DualRuntimeState {
  topRuntime: RuntimeWorld;
  bottomRuntime: RuntimeWorld;
  dominantRuntime: 'top' | 'bottom';
}
```

**Container Component:** `components/runtime/dream.DualRuntimeContainer.tsx`

Provides context and state management:
```typescript
const dualRuntime = useDualRuntime();

// API methods:
dualRuntime.setTopRuntime(world);
dualRuntime.setBottomRuntime(world);
dualRuntime.swapDominance();
dualRuntime.goToHome();
dualRuntime.isHomeActive();
```

**View Component:** `components/runtime/dream.RuntimeView.tsx`

Renders content for each runtime based on the `RuntimeWorld` type.

### Integration with HomeSystem

**File:** `components/home/dream.HomeSystem.tsx`

The HomeSystem component now wraps everything in `DualRuntimeContainer`:

```tsx
<DualRuntimeContainer>
  {() => (
    <HomeSystemInner ... />
  )}
</DualRuntimeContainer>
```

Inside, it renders both runtime views:

```tsx
<RuntimeView
  world={dualRuntime.state.topRuntime}
  isActive={dualRuntime.state.dominantRuntime === 'top'}
  ...
/>
<RuntimeView
  world={dualRuntime.state.bottomRuntime}
  isActive={dualRuntime.state.dominantRuntime === 'bottom'}
  ...
/>
```

### Dominant Runtime

The `dominantRuntime` determines which view is currently visible:
- `'top'` - The top runtime is active (visible, receives pointer events)
- `'bottom'` - The bottom runtime is active (visible, receives pointer events)

The DreamDM Bar position controls which runtime is dominant:
- Bar at bottom → Top runtime dominant (default: Home)
- Bar at top → Bottom runtime dominant (default: DreamSpace)

### Double-Tap Gold Behavior

Per the shipped contract (2026-04), double-tapping the Gold particle:
1. Resets both runtimes via `goHome()` — the canonical "go home" gesture.
2. The Gold particle is the **only** sanctioned double-tap site in the
   system. Every other UI control responds to a single tap.

Implementation in `dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx` (and the
`HomeControls` / `DreamNavControls` mirrors): a single tap is delayed by
`DOUBLE_TAP_WINDOW_MS = 260` so a follow-up tap can promote the gesture to
double-tap. The shared hook is `useHomeParticleTap` in
`lib/hooks/useTap.ts`.

```typescript
const fireLightSingleTap = useCallback(() => {
  navigator.vibrate?.(4);
  onBothMenus();
}, [onBothMenus]);

const fireLightDoubleTap = useCallback(() => {
  navigator.vibrate?.([6, 30, 6]);
  onHome();
}, [onHome]);
```

## Cross-Runtime Connection

The spec allows compatible Dreams or Daydreams opened in different runtimes to link and interact:

### Examples

1. **Code + Preview**
   - Top: CodeEngin
   - Bottom: File preview
   - Link: Live preview updates as code changes

2. **Music + Feed**
   - Top: Music Daydream
   - Bottom: Home feed
   - Link: Music state posts to feed

3. **Game + Game**
   - Top: Game Dream
   - Bottom: Same Game Dream
   - Link: Multiplayer or mirrored interaction

### Rules

1. Connection is optional and context-driven
2. Navigation remains independent
3. Only compatible Dreams/Engins link
4. Connections must be live (real-time)
5. Two instances of the same Dream can communicate if supported

**Note:** Cross-runtime linking is designed into the architecture but requires Dream-specific implementation.

## Home Default State

Per the spec, the default Home state includes:

1. **Top Runtime:** Home
2. **Contents:**
   - Home feed
   - Small compact widget/profile rail between feed and bar
   - Default widget: DreamSpace opener
3. **DreamDM Bar:** At the bottom
4. **Gold Button:** Attached to top of bar

### Behavior

- Feed scrolls independently
- Feed scroll never moves the bar
- Feed scroll never moves the Gold button (when screen-locked)
- Single tap Gold → Opens dual menus
- Double tap Gold → Resets both runtimes to Home (the only sanctioned double-tap)

## Bar Drag (2026-04 — momentum fling restored)

The **whole bar** is the drag handle on both touch and pointer devices.
Release semantics are owned by `decideBarRelease` in
`lib/dreamdm/barInteractions.ts`:

| Release | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Slow drag | Bar **parks where the user lets go** — no forced snap |
| Upward fling past `BAR_FLING_LINE_RATIO` (0.4 of screen) | Snaps to top |
| Downward fling at/below the line | Snaps to bottom |
| Already at the screen top | Snaps to top |

The "invisible 2/5 line" gives the bar emotional inertia: a deliberate slow
drag stops where you stop; a flick keeps going. Fling thresholds:
`BAR_FLING_TO_TOP_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD_PX_PER_MS = -0.9`,
`BAR_FLING_TO_BOTTOM_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD_PX_PER_MS = 0.9`.

## Bar States

### A. FLAT / CLOSED
- Bar at bottom (80px height)
- Gold button attached to top of bar
- Quick compose visible

### B. MIDDLE / COMPOSE
- Dragging to middle opens message compose
- User can type
- Releasing leaves it open
- Gold button remains attached unless position goes off-screen

### C. TOP / DREAMSPACE STATE
- Dragging all the way up snaps bar to top (340px height)
- If Gold button's attached position goes off-screen → screen-locks
- Bottom runtime becomes dominant (default: DreamSpace)
- Gold button does NOT go to bottom of bar (stays at top or screen-locked)

## Summary

The corrected Gold Button attachment rule and dual runtime system provide:

1. **Clear Attachment Logic:** Gold button attached to bar top, detaches only when off-screen
2. **Screen-Locked Behavior:** Button doesn't move with scroll when detached
3. **Flexible Runtime System:** Both runtimes can display any world, including duplicates
4. **Independent Views:** Top and bottom runtimes operate independently
5. **Proper Double-Tap:** Refreshes Home if active, else activates Home
6. **No Unwanted Detachment:** Keyboard, typing, and compose don't trigger detachment

All requirements from the spec have been implemented and tested.
