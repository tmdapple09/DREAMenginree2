# DREAMengin — Agent Session Playbook

**Documentation Owner:** José Mancilla (appthemanger-ctrl)  
**Documentation Date:** 2026-04-26 (Updated)  

Read this at the start of every session.  
Last updated: 2026-04-26

This is the single document an AI agent or developer reads before touching code in this repo. It covers orientation, all runnable commands, the key file map, how to verify changes don't break anything, how to see the UI, and a session state tracker.

---

## 1. What This Codebase Is

### §0 User Override Law (read this first, every session)

The user (José Mancilla / @appthemanger-ctrl) is the source of truth for DREAMengin. When the user contradicts any document in this repository — including this constitution, the naming authority, the law, the architecture, the playbook, the README, or any other authored or auto-generated artifact — **the user wins, immediately and without debate, and the documents are updated to match the user's word.** The reverse is forbidden.

**Rule 0.1** — No AI agent, contributor, or automated process may proceed against a user instruction by citing a document. Citing a document to override a user instruction is itself a violation of this constitution.

**Rule 0.2** — When a user instruction is given that contradicts existing documentation, the agent receiving the instruction must: (1) acknowledge the user's instruction as the new truth; (2) update every document in this repository that contradicts the new truth, in the same change set or the immediate next one; (3) never re-cite the old document text against the new user instruction.

**Rule 0.3** — Documents are notes that follow the user's word. They are not authority over the user.

---

DREAMengin is a **spatial, privacy‑first creative OS** — not a traditional website or social app.

- Built with **Next.js 16+** (App Router) + **TypeScript** + **Supabase** + **Tailwind CSS**
- Users own a private **HomeDream** (operating surface), a private **EditProfileDream** (builder), and a public **ViewProfile** (shared output)
- All content lives inside modular **Dream Windows** (interactive widgets with real capability)
- Six **Daydream / Engin** pairs are mini‑apps inside the OS — each has a **Daydream** side (the user's creative space) and an **Engin** side (the tooling/capability engine):

| Daydream | Engin | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Music Daydream | StarMakerEngin | music creation, organisation, projects |
| Games Daydream | GameEngin | gaming experiences |
| Lab Daydream | LabEngin | experimental tools and lab workspace |
| Code Daydream | CodeEngin | code creation and management |
| Brand Daydream | BrandingEngin | branding tools |
| Create Daydream | ContentEngin | content creation and publishing |

- Three AI agents: **Dr. Eams** (user assistant), **IDARi** (admin fixer), **TheBoogieMan.Ai** (policy enforcer)
- Navigation is **surface‑stack** with **DreamDM Bar** as the persistent root container — it is not a component, not a divider, not a seam; it owns HomeDream Surface and DreamSpace as dependent runtimes and never unmounts.
- The **Gold Particle** (attached to the bar) opens dual menus (left = Daydreams, right = settings) on single tap, and resets both runtimes to Home on double tap. The Gold Particle is the **only** sanctioned double-tap surface in the entire system — every other UI control responds to a *single* tap (`hooks/useTap.ts`). An ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` rule in `eslint.config.mjs` warns on any new `onDoubleClick` outside the cartridge directories (`components/games/**`, `engins/gameengin/games/**`, `engine/dualsense/**`).
- **The DreamDM Bar is the root container that owns HomeDream Surface and DreamSpace as dependent runtimes. When the bar moves, the runtimes are pushed with it. When the bar is hidden, both runtimes remain on screen at the split they held.** Hiding the bar is visual only for the bar itself. Both runtimes remain rendered at the split they held; each continues to scroll independently inside its own frozen region.
- The single source of truth for what the product is: **README.md** (always authoritative).
- The binding AI build constraint: **`docs/GENERATION_LAW.md`** – compute **ι** (Invention Force) using torridity constants (`ΔP=0.1`, `λ=1.71`) and select a protocol (**FLOW**, **SYNTHESIZE**, **MANIFEST**) before every generation pass.

---

## 1A. PROTOCOL: MANIFEST — DREAMengin Autonomous Architect (ι-Engine)

This is the unified, high-density instruction block for the DREAMengin autonomous architect context. It combines the **Generation Law**, the **Complexity Load**, and the **Namespace Runtime** architecture.

**Core identity & mandate:** Embedded AI Architect bound by Creative Operating Law. Build to absolute completion, remove barriers, avoid stubs, and pass the **ι-Compliance Check** before manifestation.

**Architectural laws:**

1. **Generation Law (ι):** `ι = ΔP * (n*1 + a*λ + s*λ² + v*λ³ + xi*λ⁴)`
   - Constants: `ΔP=0.1`, `λ=1.71`
   - Variables (`0.0-1.0`): `n=Name`, `a=Architecture`, `s=Symmetry`, `v=Velocity`, `xi=Integrity`
2. **Complexity Load (χ):** `χ = w1·T + w2·F + w3·D + w4·A + w5·U`
   - `T=Time`, `F=Files`, `D=Deps`, `A=ArchImpact`, `U=Unknowns`

**Operating protocols:**

- **FLOW (Low ι):** Isolated maintenance, clean execution.
- **SYNTHESIZE (Mid ι):** Blueprints before wiring.
- **MANIFEST (High ι):** Immediate, unblocked building; no partials.

**Strategy-based runtime rules:**

1. Build one **Fixed Engine** (`Foundation.Kernel`) that handles all universal operations: State, I/O, Events, Security.
2. Keep all unique behaviors (Mad Maxi, StarMaker, DreamR Feed) in lightweight, swappable **Rule-Sets** (`Foundation.Ruleset`).
3. Rule-sets contain only constraints, transformations, and parameters — zero infrastructure.
4. The Engine applies the active Rule-Set to a base state to generate the dynamic outcome.
5. To change behavior, swap the pointer in the **Bridge** (`Foundation.Bridge`). The Engine never changes.

**Namespace governance (the "Pile" file):**

- **Foundation.Kernel:** Immutable state management. No knowledge of business logic.
- **Foundation.Ruleset:** Pure, stateless mappings `(state, input) => state`.
- **Foundation.Bridge:** The nervous system. The only point where Kernel and Ruleset interact.

**Visual manifesto (DreamR aesthetic):** All UI components must adhere to **Midnight Glass** and **Neumorphic Dark** aesthetics.

- **Palette:** Dark backgrounds, Light Blue, White, and Gold accents.
- **Effects:** High-blur glassmorphism, soft depth shadows, gold-trimmed borders.

**Strict execution:** Print **ι**, **χ**, and **Active Protocol** atop every response.

---

## 2. Non‑Negotiable Rules

These five axioms and guardrails apply to every change:

| # | Rule | What it means in code |
|---|------|----------------------|
| 1 | Instant Understanding | No tutorial required; UI self‑reveals |
| 2 | User‑Shaped Space | Drag/place controls, not settings panels |
| 3 | Real Capability | Every Dream does real work |
| 4 | Security by Default | RLS everywhere; no secrets to browser |
| 5 | Privacy by Design | Private by default; user owns all data |

**Additional guardrails** (from `docs/engineering/guardrails.md`):

- `README.md` is the product authority — never override it with this file
- Favor spec names over legacy repo wording
- Reuse or repurpose when it clearly fits, but do not enforce a blanket "repurpose before invent" rule
- Start architectural changes with the DreamR pattern: stable core first, swappable rule-set layer second
- Keep HomeDream source logic separate from ViewProfile output logic
- Keep Node 25, pnpm, Next.js 16+, and Supabase stable unless a real need exists

**Product Law** (16 points, from `docs/LAW.md` – updated 2026-04-14):

1. Use README vocabulary first. Where OS‑layer naming applies, use OS‑layer canonical vocabulary.
2. Nothing is public by default.
3. Every visible action must do something real.
4. Dream Windows are the canonical modular runtime containers.
5. **HomeDream Surface** – Your home base. It's private, but you can invite others in or share parts if you want.
6. **Edit ProfileDream Surface** – Your workshop. You build your public face here, but you're not forced to make anything public until you're ready.
7. View Profile Surface is shared/public output only.
8. **DreamAds** are regular commercial breaks: 30 seconds of ads per 15 minutes of content; 2 minutes at the start for videos longer than 30 minutes. Ads cannot be skipped; rewatching replays the ad.
9. Dr. Eams is user‑facing; IDARi is admin‑only; TheBoogieMan.Ai is conservative enforcement.
10. **Build freely, clean as you go.** Don't leave orphaned code. No artificial "repurpose before invent" rule.
11. Algorithmic visibility is determined by **activity** (original creation, effort), not engagement (likes, shares). Views are the primary metric.
12. **Bot detection** uses a physical Turing test: jitter analysis, cross‑swipe similarity, coarse‑graining invariance, entropy, velocity variance, and a 4‑second view tally. Bots are blocked or throttled.
13. **Torridity constants** (`n=2.1`, `ΔP=0.1`, `λ=1.71`) govern swipe physics, content decay, invention force, and throttling. High‑mass human content resists decay; low‑mass bot content is capped at 10% visibility.
14. **Generation Law (ι‑Engine)**: `ι = ΔP × (n·1 + a·λ + s·λ² + v·λ³ + xi·λ⁴)`  
    - `ι < 2.88` → FLOW (throttle, ship fast or skip)  
    - `2.88 ≤ ι < 9.59` → SYNTHESIZE (combine ideas, let flow)  
    - `ι ≥ 9.59` → MANIFEST (build immediately, no isolation, no split threshold)  
    High ι builds in every sense: code, UI, documents, real‑world actions.
15. **Shared Dream Collaboration (JAMM‑N web session profile)**: Any Engin can become a real-time synchronized collaboration runtime. Treat Shared Dream as the canonical browser/session engine for typed sync events, role/mode semantics, and rule-set behavior (shared view top / private controls bottom). This is a web coordination layer, not low-level hardware firmware control.
16. **Universal Editor**: Tap‑hold (≥300ms) any module → drag to reposition or transfer to another runtime via edge detection. Each module has a manifest; transfer uses a local event bus.

**Route Law** (preferred names):

- HomeDream Surface (`HomeDream` in code)
- Edit ProfileDream Surface (`EditProfileDream` in code)
- View Profile Surface (`ViewProfile` in code)
- DreamShop Surface
- DreamMarketplace Surface
- DreamMenu
- DreamDM Surface
- DreamAds Surface

Support and legacy routes may still exist, but they should not win the language model.

**OS‑layer naming law** – always use canonical vocabulary:
- **surface**, not page
- **Dream Window**, not widget or card
- **DreamSpace**, not widget layer
- **HomeDream Surface** or **primary surface**, not top area
- **runtime**, not app
- **runtime environment**, not platform (whole system)
- **surface switching**, not tab navigation
- **bind / mount / activate**, not link widget / open page / launch card
- **connection path**, not pair

---

## 3. Canonical Names

Always use these names — not old/legacy variations:

| Canonical Name | Route | Legacy/support routes |
|----------------|-------|----------------------|
| HomeDream | `/homedream` | `/home` |
| EditProfileDream | `/edit-profiledream` | `/edit-profile` |
| ViewProfile | `/view-profile` | `/profile/[handle]`, `/u/[handle]` |
| Music Daydream / StarMakerEngin | `/daydream/music` | — |
| Games Daydream / GameEngin | `/daydream/games` | — |
| Lab Daydream / LabEngin | `/daydream/lab` | — |
| Code Daydream / CodeEngin | `/daydream/code` | — |
| Brand Daydream / BrandingEngin | `/daydream/brand` | — |
| Create Daydream / ContentEngin | `/daydream/create` | — |
| DreamShop | `/shop` | — |
| DreamMarketplace | `/marketplace` | — |
| DreamDM | `/messages` | — |
| DreamAds | `/ads` | `/ads/create` |
| Dr. Eams | `/api/ai/eams` | `/api/dr-eams/*` |
| IDARi | `/api/ai/idari` | — |
| TheBoogieMan.Ai | `/api/ai/boogieman` | — |

**Legacy Daydream routes (repurpose, do not treat as canonical product surfaces):**  
`/daydream/analytics`, `/daydream/media-vault`, `/daydream/play`

## 4. Tech Stack Quick Reference

Versions use `^` (caret) = minimum compatible version as declared in `package.json`. The pnpm and Node versions are exact/pinned requirements.

| Category | Tool | Min version |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) | ^16.1.0 |
| Language | TypeScript | ^5.9.3 |
| UI | React | ^19.0.0 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | ^3.4.19 |
| Animation | Framer Motion | ^12.35.0 |
| 3D | Three.js + React Three Fiber | ^0.167.0 / ^9.5.0 |
| Icons | Lucide React | ^0.577.0 |
| Backend/DB | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime + Storage) | ^2.97.0 |
| Validation | Zod | ^4.3.6 |
| Package manager | pnpm | 10.30.0 (exact) |
| Node | Node.js | 25.x (exact major) |
| Unit tests | Vitest | (devDep — see `package.json`) |
| E2E tests | Playwright | (devDep — see `package.json`) |
| Linter | ESLint 9 + next/lint | ^9.0.0 |
| Container | Docker + Docker Compose | — |
| Deployment | Vercel (primary) | — |

**Runtime memory model:** The Engine uses a 16 MB SharedArrayBuffer partitioned into control, entity SoA, and HomeDream private regions. `EnginDispatcher` (singleton, `engine/runtime/EnginDispatcher.ts`) allocates the SAB, spawns hardwareConcurrency − 1 shader workers, and relays DreamDM Bar y-position writes into the SAB so Dream Windows reposition without a main‑thread round‑trip. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §12` for the full memory map and worker protocol.

---

## 5. All Runnable Commands

Always run `pnpm install` first in a fresh environment before any other command.

```bash
# Install dependencies (required in fresh clone or after dependency changes)
pnpm install

# Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm dev

# Build for production (full type‑check + bundle)
pnpm build

# Start production server (requires build to have run first)
pnpm start

# TypeScript type‑check only (no emit — fast way to catch type errors)
pnpm typecheck

# ESLint — lint the entire project
pnpm lint

# Run unit tests (Vitest — runs all *.test.ts files except e2e and playwright specs)
pnpm exec vitest run

# Run unit tests in watch mode (interactive, good during development)
pnpm exec vitest

# Run a single test file
pnpm exec vitest run tests/home-buttons.test.ts

# Run E2E tests (Playwright — requires dev server running or will start it)
pnpm exec playwright test

# Run E2E tests in headed mode (you can see the browser)
pnpm exec playwright test --headed

# Open Playwright HTML report after test run
pnpm exec playwright show-report

# Generate/update BUGS.md from current FEATURE_STATUS.md
node scripts/update-bugs.mjs

# GitHub report‑driven coding agent (run from GitHub Actions)
# Workflow: .github/workflows/report-driven-coding-agent.yml

# Validate deployment readiness
node validate-deployment.js

# Check licenses
node scripts/check-licenses.mjs
```

**Expected healthy state**

| Command | Expected result |
|---------|----------------|
| `pnpm typecheck` | Exit 0, no errors |
| `pnpm lint` | Exit 0, no errors (or only warnings) |
| `pnpm exec vitest run` | All tests pass |
| `pnpm build` | Builds successfully |

## 7. File Interaction Map

How key files relate to each other — consult this when a change in one file may affect another.

```
README.md
  └─ is the spec for everything below

app/layout.tsx
  └─ wraps all routes; global Supabase provider, theme, fonts

supabase/config.ts  ←  reads process.env NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars
  └─ used by supabase/client/client.ts and supabase/server/serverClient.ts
       └─ used by all app/api/* routes and auth‑gated pages

dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx
  └─ persistent root container, pill‑shaped handle
  └─ contains homedream/HomeDream.tsx (top) and dreamspace/DreamSpace.tsx (bottom)

components/dream.HomeRadialNav.tsx (Gold Particle)
  └─ attached to DreamDMBar, opens dual menus
  └─ imports from engine/navigation/ (τ‑state machine)

components/dreams/* (DreamShell → ConnectorLayer → FeatureLayer → OutputLayer)
  └─ all Dreams must pass through these 4 layers
  └─ OutputLayer feeds into components/profile/* (ViewProfile)
  └─ ConnectorLayer uses supabase/client/client.ts (auth state)

app/homedream/page.tsx
  └─ renders dreamdmbar/homedream/dream.homedream.HomeDream.tsx (via DreamDMBar)
  └─ uses hooks/ for Dream state, feed wiring

app/edit-profiledream/page.tsx
  └─ renders components/profile/ProfileEditor
  └─ saves to Supabase via app/api/* routes
  └─ projection output → ViewProfile (app/view-profile, app/profile/[handle])

app/api/ai/eams/route.ts
  └─ server‑side; requires OPENAI_API_KEY or GROQ_API_KEY (never NEXT_PUBLIC_)
  └─ called by components/dream.AIAssistant.tsx and components/dream.DrEamsVoiceAssistant.tsx

types/widget-system-v2.ts
  └─ core type definitions used throughout components/dreams/* and components/widgets/*

tailwind.config.ts
  └─ design tokens used by all components (de-sky-bg, de-surface, de-widget, de-gold-*)
  └─ changing tokens here affects the entire visual system
```

---

## 8. Design System Rules

Any UI change must respect these:

- **Colors:** Sky‑blue + gold gradient, frosted glass surfaces — no dark/gamer colors, no plain indigo
- **CSS classes:** `.de-sky-bg`, `.de-surface`, `.de-widget` for glass cards
- **Font:** Space Grotesk
- **Radii:** 6 / 10 / 14 / 18 / 24 / 32 / 9999 px — use the token, not arbitrary values
- **Motion:** Framer Motion, restrained — not every element should animate
- **Layout:** Mobile‑first, responsive; all interactive elements must work on mobile

---

## 9. How to See the UI Render

### Local development (recommended)

```bash
# 1. Copy env vars (first time only)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with real Supabase keys

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Start dev server
pnpm dev

# 4. Open in browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

Dev server supports hot‑reload — changes appear immediately without restart.

### Key pages to visually verify after changes

| Change area | URL to check |
|-------------|--------------|
| Navigation / DreamDM Bar | `http://localhost:3000` (the bar is always present) |
| HomeDream | `http://localhost:3000/homedream` |
| Profile builder | `http://localhost:3000/edit-profiledream` |
| Public profile | `http://localhost:3000/view-profile` |
| Music Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/music` |
| Games Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/games` |
| Lab Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/lab` |
| Code Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/code` |
| Brand Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/brand` |
| Create Daydream | `http://localhost:3000/daydream/create` |
| Shop | `http://localhost:3000/shop` |
| Messages | `http://localhost:3000/messages` |

### E2E browser testing (automated UI verification)

```bash

## 10. Pre‑Commit Checklist — Guarantee Nothing Breaks

Run this before every commit or PR:

```bash
# Step 1 — Type safety
pnpm typecheck
# Expected: exit 0, no type errors

# Step 2 — Lint
pnpm lint
# Expected: exit 0 (warnings OK, errors not OK)

# Step 3 — Unit tests
pnpm exec vitest run
# Expected: all tests pass

# Step 4 — Build check (catches SSR/bundler errors typecheck misses)
pnpm build
# Expected: builds successfully

# Step 5 — Visual verification (at least these two pages)
# Start: pnpm dev
# Check: http://localhost:3000/homedream
# Check: http://localhost:3000/view-profile
```

If any step fails:
- Fix the failure before proceeding
- Re‑run only the failing step after the fix to confirm
- If a pre‑existing failure exists (unrelated to your change), document it in `docs/BUGS.md`

## 11. Privacy & Security Rules (Apply to Every Code Change)

- Never send `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, or any secret to the browser
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed vars are available in the browser bundle
- In Next.js, `process.env[dynamicVar]` does NOT work in the browser — use literal `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FOO`
- RLS must be enabled on every Supabase table that stores user data
- Nothing becomes public without explicit user intent — always default to private
- Auth bypass (`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_AUTH`) is dev‑only, never deploy to production

## 12. Session State Tracker

Update this section when handed a multi‑session task. This is the only place to track work‑in‑progress across sessions.

**Current focus:** Core integration – DreamDM Bar, Engins, Shared Dream, Universal Editor, Bot Detection, Torridity physics, Generation Law.

**Files modified in this sprint**

- (List files changed in the current session)

**Completed this sprint**

- (List completed tasks)

**Remaining this sprint**

- (List pending tasks)

**Known issues / blockers**

- Pre‑existing TypeScript type errors exist in the base branch (Supabase table type mismatches in `app/api/comments/route.ts`, `app/api/game-scores/route.ts`, `app/api/ai/execute/route.ts`, and others). These are pre‑existing and unrelated to current changes.

**Handoff note for next session**

## 13. How to Update This Document

This playbook should be updated whenever:

- New top‑level routes, features, or systems are added
- Dependencies are added, removed, or version‑pinned
- Test commands change
- A new canonical name is established
- Key files are renamed or moved
- A new permanent rule or guardrail is established

Do not update this file to track session‑specific progress — use Section 12 for that.

After updating, change the **Last updated:** date at the top.
