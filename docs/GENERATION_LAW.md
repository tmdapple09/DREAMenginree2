## DREAMengin Vision Alignment Guard

This document must not drift away from the DREAMengin canonical product contract.

Interpret this file under these rules:

- DREAMengin is a web-native creative OS/world, not disconnected pages.
- Dreams, posts, messages, games, assets, tools, settings, profiles, media, workspaces, and shared sessions must operate as one connected system.
- Every visible feature must satisfy: visible user action → reachable handler → real runtime/API/state behavior → persisted or visible result → clear feedback/error state.
- DreamDMBar is the canonical search/control/menu layer.
- DreamR owns feed/profile/posts/comments/messages/social identity, with one canonical edit-profile path.
- HomeDream and DreamSpace must be real operating surfaces, not decorative grids.
- Engins are first-class capabilities with real surfaces, state, actions, runtime behavior, and mobile-smooth UI.
- RenderEngin is rendering technology used by Engins, especially ContentEngin first, not a standalone fake destination.
- Settings, language, uploads, media, YouTube behavior, customization, Shared Dreams, offline behavior, performance, security, accessibility, and observability must connect to canonical state.
- AI-like behavior should be deterministic and work without live AI where possible.
- Code should follow the DREAMengin grammar: directive → imports → identity/law → constants → types → helpers → owned state → derived gates → named actions → effects/cleanup → render/return → export.

If this document describes a feature, route, surface, tool, setting, or Engin behavior, it must not imply fake buttons, decorative controls, duplicate ownership, unreachable pages, hidden failures, or placeholder panels pretending to work.

Status: binding AI build constraint  
Last updated: 2026-03-16

This document is the authoritative expansion of README.md §27.  
Every AI agent (Dr. Eams, IDARi, TheBoogieMan.Ai, or any external Copilot) must read and apply it before each generation pass.

## 1. Allowed-Output Formula

```
allowed next output = base spec fidelity × (ДР / 2) × (1 + ДРх)
```

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **base spec fidelity** | How closely the current codebase matches README.md. Expressed as a value from 0 (nothing matches) to 1 (full conformance). Estimate by auditing open items in FEATURE_STATUS.md. |
| **ДР** | Delta ratio — the fraction of the total spec addressed by this pass (e.g., adding one route = small ДР; rewriting the full widget system = large ДР). |
| **ДРх** | Residual-adjusted ДР. Subtract the residual penalty before computing: ДРх = ДР − (open residuals / total spec sections). |

**Rule:** if the scope of a planned pass would exceed `allowed next output`, the pass must be split into smaller sub-passes or down-graded to **patch only** mode before any file is opened.

---

## 2. App-Build Load (χ)

Compute χ before writing a single line of code:

```
χ = w₁T + w₂F + w₃D + w₄A + w₅U
```

### 2.1 Variables

| Symbol | Meaning | Default weight |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| T | Number of distinct tasks attempted in this pass | w₁ = 1.0 |
| F | Number of files touched | w₂ = 0.5 |
| D | Dependency surface changed — new npm packages, new Supabase columns, new env vars, new imports from outside the touched file tree | w₃ = 1.5 |
| A | Architecture depth affected — count of the 4 layers (Surface / Component / Logic / Data) that are modified | w₄ = 2.0 |
| U | Unresolved spec ambiguities carried into this pass from a previous session | w₅ = 1.0 |

Weights are platform-wide defaults. IDARi may tune them per domain via the admin panel.

### 2.2 Mode Thresholds

| χ range | Mode | What is permitted |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| χ < 4 | **create** | New files, new routes, new components, new DB tables, new top-level systems |
| 4 ≤ χ < 8 | **conform** | Modify existing files to align with spec; no new top-level systems |
| χ ≥ 8 | **patch only** | Single-file, single-function fixes; no structural change; no new imports |

If a planned pass yields χ ≥ 8, decompose it into sub-passes (each with its own χ check) before proceeding.

### 2.3 Example

A pass that: fixes one bug (T=1), touches 3 files (F=3), adds no new deps (D=0), stays in the Component layer only (A=1), with 0 ambiguities (U=0):

```
χ = 1.0×1 + 0.5×3 + 1.5×0 + 2.0×1 + 1.0×0 = 1 + 1.5 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4.5  →  conform
```

## 3. Residual Classes

A residual is a typed mismatch between actual AI output and spec-intended output:

```
r = actual output − predicted output
```

Residuals are not numbers first — they are structured mismatches. Seven classes exist. Every pass must audit for all of them.
Here's a rewritten version based on the current naming grammar, the 4-layer model, and the Generation Law / SICC principles you've established.

---

### 3.1 Architecture Residual

**Question:** Does the code match the 4‑layer DREAMengin model?

| Layer | Location | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Surface** | `app/` routes, `page.tsx` files | Entry points only — no logic, no data access. Thin shims that import and render a `dreamsurface.*` component. |
| **Component** | `components/`, `engins/` | UI atoms, shells, menus, widgets, and the six canonical Engins (`engin.*Engin.tsx`). |
| **Logic** | `lib/`, `hooks/`, `utils/` | Business logic, data transforms, state management, API clients, the Generation Law engine. |
| **Data** | `supabase/`, RLS policies, `types/`, `schema/` | Database schemas, queries, type definitions, migrations. |

**Residual is present when:**
- Logic or data access appears directly in a Surface file (`app/*/page.tsx`).
- A Component file contains database queries instead of calling a `lib/` or `hooks/` function.
- A new system is placed at the wrong layer (e.g., a payment processor lives in `components/checkout/` instead of `lib/commerce/`).
- A pass touches all four layers in a single change (A=4 → χ spikes). Decompose the pass into focused steps unless ι ≥ 9.59 (MANIFEST) demands otherwise.

---

### 3.2 Naming Residual

**Question:** Does the code use the canonical naming grammar defined in `docs/NAMING_AUTHORITY.md` (especially §14)?

**Immutable parent prefixes:**

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `engin.` | One of the six canonical runtimes (StarMaker, Game, Lab, Code, Branding, Content) | `engin.GameEngin.tsx` |
| `dream.` | Any user‑facing component, cartridge, HUD, remote, or control that belongs to an Engin | `dream.cartridge.NullCathedral.tsx` |
| `dreamsurface.` | A runtime Surface (HomeDream, EditProfileDream, ViewProfile, Daydream surfaces, etc.) | `dreamsurface.HomeDream.tsx` |

**Approved sub‑prefixes (exactly one per file, after the parent prefix):**

| For `dream.*` | For `dreamsurface.*` |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `cartridge`, `panel`, `hud`, `remote`, `scene`, `window`, `widget`, `menu`, `bar`, `shell`, `overlay` | `core`, `daydream`, `module` |

**Do not use:**  
`component`, `ui`, `view`, `page`, `util`, `helper`, `lib`, `test`, `spec`, `legacy`, `old`, `v2`, `route` as sub‑prefixes or file name segments.

**Residual is present when:**
- An `engin.` file has a sub‑prefix (e.g., `engin.game.Runtime.tsx`).
- A `dream.` or `dreamsurface.` file uses a disallowed sub‑prefix or more than one sub‑prefix.
- A file containing an Engin, Dream, or Surface concept does not use the required parent prefix.
- The vocabulary from §13 of `NAMING_AUTHORITY.md` is violated (e.g., calling a Surface a “page”, calling an Engin an “engine”).

---

This version removes outdated references (like the old table of canonical names) and aligns with the current `engin.` / `dream.` / `dreamsurface.` grammar, the sub‑prefix whitelist, and the 4‑layer architecture rules.

**Residual is present when:**
- Legacy names appear in new route files, component names, or variable names without a redirect or explicit alias comment
- A UI string shown to the user uses a non-canonical name
- OS-layer rejected terms (widget, page, dashboard, card, app, tab) appear in user-facing copy

---

### 3.3 Token Residual

**Question:** Does the code use design-system tokens rather than arbitrary values?

**Required colour tokens (from THEME.md):**

| Intent | Token class | Hex |
|--------|------------|-----|
| Action / save / premium | `de-gold` | `#F5C842` |
| Connected / live | `de-sky` | `#64B5F6` |
| Surfaces | `de-surface` / white | `#FFFFFF` |

**Allowed border-radius values (px):** 6, 10, 14, 18, 24, 32, 9999

**Residual is present when:**
- Raw hex or RGB values appear in component styles for the above intents
- Arbitrary Tailwind colour classes are used where a token applies (e.g., `text-yellow-400` instead of `text-de-gold`)
- A border-radius value outside the allowed token set appears (e.g., `rounded-lg` = 8px is not in the set)
- A new colour is introduced without a corresponding token entry in THEME.md

---

### 3.4 Behavior Residual

**Question:** Do all visible actions map to real system actions?

**Residual is present when:**
- A button or link has an empty or stub handler (`onClick={() => {}}`, `href="#"`)
- A toggle or switch has no persisted outcome (state changes in memory but is never saved)
- A navigation element routes to a 404 or placeholder page
- A form submits but the data is discarded
- An action is presented in the UI but marked "coming soon" without a gating mechanism

---

### 3.5 Privacy Residual

**Question:** Did the AI expose private builder state publicly?

**Residual is present when:**
- A query or API response returns data belonging to a user other than the authenticated requester without an explicit visibility permission record
- EditProfileDream draft state appears on ViewProfile before the user has explicitly saved and shared it
- RLS is missing or bypassed (`service_role` used where `anon` / `authenticated` should govern)
- A `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env variable carries a secret or non-public credential
- An API route returns user data without checking the authenticated session
- The `visibility_mappings` table is not consulted before rendering shared content on ViewProfile

---

### 3.6 Performance Residual

**Question:** Does the code violate DREAMengin performance rules?

**Rules:**

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Render on demand | Components must not render heavy content on mount when idle; trigger on interaction or intersection |
| Interactive animations | ≥ 60 fps |
| Passive animations | ≥ 30 fps |
| Static Three.js meshes | Must be frozen — call `geometry.dispose()` / set static flag; never re-create per frame |
| Post-processing | Bloom, depth-of-field, and other passes must be conditionally gated (device capability check); never on by default |

**Residual is present when:**
- A component eager-loads a heavy resource (3D scene, large image set) on mount without an idle or intersection trigger
- An animation drops below the fps threshold (measure with React DevTools Profiler or Three.js stats)
- A Three.js geometry or material is re-instantiated on every render cycle
- A post-processing pass is unconditionally applied to all devices

---

### 3.7 Projection Residual

**Question:** Does ViewProfile render only saved, explicitly shared projections?

A **projection** is a domain-specific output record (music project, game profile, brand kit, etc.) that a user has saved in one of the 6 Daydream / Engin pairs and chosen to share publicly.

**Residual is present when:**
- ViewProfile reads live EditProfileDream state directly instead of reading from a saved projection record
- A projection appears on ViewProfile that the user has not saved and set `visibility = shared`
- The rendering pipeline bypasses the `visibility_mappings` table
- A draft or in-progress Daydream object is visible to other users before explicit publish

---

## 4. Per-Pass Audit Checklist

Run this checklist at the **start** and **end** of every generation pass. File any failing item in BUGS.md before opening a new create-mode pass.

```
PRE-PASS
[ ] χ computed — mode confirmed (create / conform / patch only)
[ ] allowed next output computed — scope fits within limit
[ ] No unresolved residuals from the previous pass (check BUGS.md)

POST-PASS
[ ] Architecture residual — layers respected? No logic in Surface, no DB in Component?
[ ] Naming residual — canonical README names used throughout?
[ ] Token residual — de-gold / de-sky / de-surface tokens; correct border-radius values?
[ ] Behavior residual — every visible action does something real?
[ ] Privacy residual — no private state exposed publicly; RLS intact?
[ ] Performance residual — render-on-demand; fps targets met; frozen static meshes?
[ ] Projection residual — ViewProfile shows only saved shared projections?
```

Any residual discovered during the post-pass audit must be:
1. Logged in BUGS.md with the residual class and affected file(s)
2. Resolved in a dedicated conform-mode pass before the next create-mode pass is permitted
