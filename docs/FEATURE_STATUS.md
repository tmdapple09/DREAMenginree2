## Activity-First Protocol (v2.1 target)

Canonical spec: `docs/ACTIVITY_FIRST_PROTOCOL.md` — Active Platform Law (2026-03-25)

| Feature | Status | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `activity_points` table (decaying 30-day sum) | ✅ | Migration `20260413000000_phase9_activity_first_protocol.sql`; decay logic in `dreamr/activity/scoring.ts`. |
| `activity_verification` table (evidence of activity) | ✅ | Migration + `POST /api/activity/track`; `ActivityPostForm` captures verification method and evidence. |
| `views` table (verified human views) | ✅ | Migration + `POST /api/views/track`; feed API exposes verified `views_count`. |
| `skip_credits` table (user credit balance) | ✅ | Migration + skip-credit APIs; `SkipCreditBalance` is mounted in the persistent DreamDM shell. |
| `ad_views` table (verified ad views for billing) | ✅ | Migration + `POST /api/ads/view`; `AdUnit` records CPV ad views. |
| `user_metrics` table (AQS, Real Shit Rate) | ✅ | Migration + `GET /api/metrics/user/[userId]`; profile surfaces display metrics through `ActivityProfile`. |
| `visibility_score` feed ranking (replaces engagement ranking) | ✅ | `app/api/feed/route.ts` defaults to `sort=activity` and calls `sortByVisibilityScore`. |
| Activity Quality Score (AQS) as core metric | ✅ | `dreamr/activity/aqs.ts`; shown on public profile, ViewProfile preview, and EditProfileDream. |
| Activity tier multipliers (Tier 0–6) | ✅ | `dreamr/activity/scoring.ts`; current 30-day tier badge shown in profile metrics. |
| Points decay over 30-day rolling window | ✅ | Migration function `apply_points_decay()` and scoring helpers. |
| Profile: total views + AQS + Real Shit Rate display | ✅ | `ActivityProfile` wired into `/profile/[handle]`, `/view-profile`, and `/edit-profiledream`. |
| Feed: view count prominent, no like count | ✅ | Feed API returns verified views and uses activity ranking by default; engagement sorting remains explicit legacy mode only. |
| Ad units: Pre-Roll, Post-Roll, Rewarded (no mid-roll) | ✅ | `components/ads/dream.AdUnit.tsx`; HomeDream feed uses rewarded boundary ads. |
| Skip credit system (earn + auto-apply) | ✅ | Skip-credit APIs + persistent shell balance display + `AdUnit` skip/use flow. |
| `AD` badge on all ad placements | ✅ | `AdUnit` renders an `AD` label for placement clarity. |
| CPV billing (Standard $0.08 / Premium $0.12 / Super $0.15) | ✅ | `dreamr/activity/types.ts` + `POST /api/ads/view` CPV verification path. |
| TheBoogieMan.Ai harmful content enforcement (search-only, no feed) | ✅ | BoogieMan policy routes and child-safety tests cover conservative enforcement. |
| TheBoogieMan.Ai fraud detection (fake check-ins, bot views) | ✅ | Activity verification/fraud fields, bot detection modules, and view/ad verification APIs. |
| Parental controls — minors blocked from harmful content by default | ✅ | Child-safety API/UI and `tests/child-safety.test.ts`. |
| IDARi platform health dashboard (Real Shit Rate, AQS, etc.) | ✅ | `/idari-console/platform-health` renders `PlatformHealth`; admin console links to it. |
| Ad revenue split (30% platform / 50% creator / 20% reward pool) | ✅ | `tests/activity-revenue-split.test.ts` covers the canonical split. |
| Activity Reward Pool monthly distribution | ✅ | Activity/revenue split logic is covered by Phase 9 tests. |

## 0. v2.0.0 checklist

| Item | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical naming wins across UI/routes/docs | ✅ | `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts` is single authority. All 🟡 naming items closed. Surface labels in WorkspaceDashboard use canonical names. |
| HomeDream is the clear product center | ✅ | `/homedream` is runtime root. `/dreamengin` (orbit shell) redirects to `/homedream`. No competing home shell. |
| Parallel old/new UI layers stop competing | ✅ | `components/v1-ui/` archived. `/dreamengin`, `/codespace`, `/physics-lab` all redirect to canonical Daydream routes. Archive headers on 12 dead root-level components. |
| Dreams / Daydreams / Engins legible to outsiders | ✅ | `/codespace` → `/daydream/code`. `/physics-lab` → `/daydream/lab`. `/music` → `/daydream/music`. DreamDMBar routes aligned. Quick-action labels use canonical surface names. |
| Auth + onboarding + entry reliable | ✅ | `/join` (email) → `/onboarding` → HomeDream. `/join` (OAuth) → `/auth/callback?next=/onboarding` → `/onboarding`. Returning users → `/homedream`. |
| SuperDreamWidget composition aligned | ✅ | `components/dreams/dream.widget.SuperDreamWidget.tsx` with real cluster composition rules. |
| AI triad coordination bus active | ✅ | `engine/agents/agentBus.ts` — client event bridge live. `runTriadConsensus` gate active server-side. DreamDMBar `dreams` surface uses `toggleDrEams()` (not legacy route). |
| Clutter pass complete | ✅ | v1-ui CSS removed from global layout. Archive headers on 12 dead components. Dead routes redirected. |
| Motion restraint pass complete | ✅ | GodTier blur (0.15/0.10). GlowLayer kernel 16. All transitions intentional. |
| Profile/public boundary clean | ✅ | `visibility_mappings` authoritative. ViewProfile reads projections only. Nothing public by default. |
| Build enforcement updated for v2 | ✅ | `engine/agents/adari.ts` + `scripts/postbuild.js` require v2 canonical files (not WheelLayout/WidgetEngine/etc.). Version check included. |
| PRODUCT_VERSION in canonical-names | ✅ | `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts` exports `PRODUCT_VERSION = '2.0.0'`. |
| package.json version | ✅ | `"version": "2.0.0"`. |

## 1. Core surfaces

| Surface | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| HomeDream | ✅ | Canonical route exists at `/homedream`; support route also exists at `/home`. |
| EditProfileDream | ✅ | Canonical route `/edit-profiledream`. Legacy `/edit-profile` redirects. Naming fully aligned. |
| ViewProfile | ✅ | Canonical route `/view-profile`. Projection boundary clean: reads only from `visibility_mappings`. Public handle route `/profile/[handle]` uses same projection path. |

## 2. Dreams system

| Module | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| DreamShell layer | ✅ | `components/dreams/dreamsurface.shell.tsx` exists. |
| Connector/Identity layer | ✅ | `components/dreams/dream.connectorlayer.tsx` exists. |
| Feature layer | ✅ | `components/dreams/dream.featurelayer.tsx` exists. |
| Output/Projection layer | ✅ | `components/dreams/dream.outputlayer.tsx` exists. |
| Legacy widget absorption into Dreams naming | ✅ | `components/widgets/*` repurposed; v1-ui layer archived. `types/dream-window.ts` is the single type authority. |
| Automatic Super Widget composition | ✅ | `components/dreams/dream.widget.SuperDreamWidget.tsx` has real cluster composition rules (StarMaker, GameSphere, BrandDream, LabCode, ContentStream). |

## 2a. Dreams Space (second runtime)

| Feature | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| DreamsSpacePanel — separate runtime panel | ✅ | `components/dreams/dreamsurface.dreamspace.tsx`; revealed by dragging DreamDMBar upward. |
| useDreamsRuntime hook | ✅ | `engine/dreams/useDreamsRuntime.ts`; independent navigation state separate from home runtime. |
| Daydreams as priority in Dreams Space | ✅ | DreamsSpacePanel surfaces all 6 Daydreams as the first/default tab (`✦ Daydreams`), per README runtime model. |
| Live routes to all 6 Daydreams from Dreams Space | ✅ | Each tile in the Daydreams tab links directly to `/daydream/music`, `/daydream/games`, `/daydream/lab`, `/daydream/code`, `/daydream/brand`, `/daydream/create`. |
| Connector feeds (YouTube / GitHub / Spotify) | ✅ | Available in the secondary `✨ Feeds` tab; service sub-tabs preserved. |
| Whole-bar drag handle | ✅ | `dreamdmbar/dreamsurface.dreamdmbar.tsx` — pointer drag fires from anywhere on the bar (not just the gold particle). Touch already had this. |
| Momentum fling release | ✅ | `dreamdmbar/runtime/barInteractions.ts::decideBarRelease` — slow drag parks where you let go; upward fling past the invisible 2/5 line snaps to top; downward fling at/below the line snaps to bottom. Test: `tests/decide-bar-release.test.ts`. |
| Single-tap discipline | ✅ | `hooks/useTap.ts` — `useTap` (canonical single-tap) + `useHomeParticleTap` (the only sanctioned double-tap site, gold particle only). |
| Solo-parity runtime channel | ✅ | `engine/runtime/runtimeChannel.ts` — `LocalChannel` (in-mem pub/sub) + `RealtimeChannel` (lazy Supabase, graceful local fallback) + `createRuntimeChannel(id, mode)` factory. Solo == co-op with one peer. Tests: `tests/runtime-channel.test.ts`. |
| Manifest `solo` / `coop` flags | ✅ | `engine/feature-build/featureManifest.ts::DaydreamEnginManifest` gained optional `solo: boolean` and `coop: boolean \| { affordances: string[] }` (backwards-compatible). |

## 3. Daydream pairs

| Pair | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Music / StarMakerEngin | ✅ | `app/daydream/music/page.tsx` exists; `components/daydream/StarMakerEngin.tsx` exists. |
| Games / GameEngin | ✅ | `app/daydream/games/page.tsx` exists; `components/daydream/GameEngin.tsx` created (Phase 6). |
| Lab / LabEngin | ✅ | `app/daydream/lab/page.tsx` exists; `components/daydream/LabEngin.tsx` exists. |
| Code / CodeEngin | ✅ | `app/daydream/code/page.tsx` exists; `components/daydream/CodeEngin.tsx` exists. |

| Create / ContentEngin | ✅ | `app/daydream/create/page.tsx` exists; `components/daydream/ContentEngin.tsx` exists. |
| DaydreamShell sideBComponent prop | ✅ | `components/daydream/dream.shell.DaydreamShell.tsx` now accepts `sideBComponent` prop (Phase 6). |
| useDaydreamState hook | ✅ | `daydreams/shared/useDaydreamState.ts` created (Phase 6). |
| Legacy extra daydream routes | 🟡 | `analytics`, `media-vault`, and `play` still exist and must be repurposed (Phase 6). |

## 4. Platform modules

| Module | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| DreamMenu | ✅ | Canonical: `components/menus/dream.menu.DreamRadialMenu.tsx`. `HomeRadialNav.tsx` (legacy, was unused) replaced with redirect stub re-exporting from canonical. `DualBottomMenu.tsx` wraps DreamRadialMenu + SystemRadialMenu for the seam. Phase 6 item 10 complete. |

| DreamAds | ✅ | `app/ads/page.tsx` now renders "My DreamAds — Available" and "Platform Promotions" as distinct sections. Migration `20260321000000_ads_platform_promotions.sql` adds `is_platform_promotion` column. Phase 6 item 11 complete. |

## 5. AI triad

| AI | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Dr. Eams | ✅ | Canonical route at `/api/ai/eams`. `DrEamsSearchBar` wired in HomeDream (`WorkspaceDashboard`); `onOpenDrEams` calls real `openDrEams` from `DreamSystemContext`. Send-to-DreamDM routing live. Phase 6 item 5 complete. |
| IDARi | ✅ | `/api/ai/idari` exists; admin-guard enforced even under dev bypass; `IDARI_PASSWORD` env check returns 503 when absent. 15 guard tests in `tests/idari-admin-guard.test.ts`. Phase 6 item 6 complete. |
| TheBoogieMan.Ai | ✅ | `/api/ai/boogieman` and `/api/ai/boogieman/privacy-event` exist. Visibility-change events logged on `handleSave`; publish events logged on `handlePublish` in EditProfileDream. Phase 6 item 7 complete. |
| AI Triad coordination bus | ✅ | `engine/agents/agentBus.ts` — client-side event bridge live. `runTriadConsensus` gate active server-side for delete-dream and critical ops. |

## 6. Privacy and profile integrity

| Rule | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Nothing public by default | ✅ | Enforced at data layer. `visibility_mappings` table consulted on ViewProfile before rendering any Dream Window. Default is `private`. |
| Save before public/shared update | ✅ | EditProfileDream has separate "Save Draft" (`handleSave`) and "Publish" (`handlePublish`) buttons with separate API calls. Visibility-change events logged by TheBoogieMan on save. |
| No fake actions | ✅ | `onOpenDrEams` empty handlers replaced with real `openDrEams`; marketplace "Request" buttons replaced with real navigation links. Phase 6 item 13 complete. |
| RLS on all user tables | 🟡 | RLS is documented as required; full audit of all Supabase tables is a Phase 6 item. |

## 7. Design language

| Rule | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Gold / light blue / white premium palette | ✅ | Theme docs and CSS tokens support this direction. |
| Minimal clutter | ✅ | v1-ui CSS removed from global layout and HomeDream. Dream Rail (v2) CSS scoped to `styles/home-dream.css`. Legacy CSS archived in `components/v1-ui/`. |
| Intentional motion | ✅ | GodTier blur reduced (blurStrength 0.15/0.10). GlowLayer blurKernelSize 16. All animations purposeful and restrained. |

## 8. Phase 6 priorities

The following items are the Phase 6 focus. See `docs/dreamengin_phase6.md` for the full 50-point spec.

1. ✅ Add `components/daydream/GameEngin.tsx` (Games Daydream Side B) — done.
2. ✅ Create `daydreams/shared/useDaydreamState.ts` (shared Daydream/Engin state hook) — done.
3. ✅ Wire `sideBComponent` prop into `DaydreamShell`; wire `GameEngin` into Games page — done.
4. ✅ Surface Daydreams as priority in Dreams Space with live routes from second runtime — done.
5. ✅ Integrate Dr. Eams as HomeDream search bar with send-to-DreamDM routing — done. `DrEamsSearchBar` wired in `WorkspaceDashboard`; `onOpenDrEams` now calls real `openDrEams` from `DreamSystemContext` (was `() => {}` — Phase 6 Item 13 fix applied simultaneously).
6. ✅ Enforce IDARi admin-guard even under dev auth bypass — done. IDARI_PASSWORD env check added to `app/api/ai/idari/route.ts`; returns 503 when absent. 15 guard contract tests added in `tests/idari-admin-guard.test.ts`.
7. ✅ Wire TheBoogieMan privacy-event logging for visibility changes — done. `handleSave` in `EditProfileDream` now detects per-widget visibility changes and POSTs `VISIBILITY_CHANGE` events to `/api/ai/boogieman/privacy-event`. `handlePublish` already logged `EXPLICIT_SHARE` events.
8. ✅ Consult `visibility_mappings` before rendering any content on ViewProfile — done. `view-profile/page.tsx` now queries `visibility_mappings` table and uses it as authoritative source (falls back to widget visibility field). Migration `20260316000000_visibility_mappings.sql` already existed.
9. ✅ Separate private-save and explicit-share flows in EditProfileDream — done. `handleSave` (draft) and `handlePublish` (explicit share) are separate callbacks with separate buttons ("Save Draft" vs "Publish").
10. ✅ Unify DreamMenu under a single canonical implementation — done. `components/menus/dream.menu.DreamRadialMenu.tsx` is canonical. `HomeRadialNav.tsx` (unused) replaced with redirect stub re-exporting from canonical. `DualBottomMenu.tsx` wraps `DreamRadialMenu` + `SystemRadialMenu` for the seam.
11. ✅ Separate user DreamAds from platform promotions in code and UI language — done. Migration `20260321000000_ads_platform_promotions.sql` adds `is_platform_promotion` to `ad_listings`. Ads surface now renders "My DreamAds — Available" and "Platform Promotions" as distinct sections.
12. ✅ Repurpose legacy Daydream routes (`analytics`, `media-vault`, `play`) — done. analytics is now a **real Analytics Daydream** surface (social media analytics for branding): `app/daydream/analytics/page.tsx` + `engins/dream.panel.AnalyticsEngin.tsx`. media-vault → /daydream/create, play → /daydream/games.
13. ✅ Complete real-capability audit: replace all fake actions with real ones — done. `onOpenDrEams={() => {}}` in `HomeSystem.tsx` (both RuntimeView instances) replaced with real `openDrEams` from `DreamSystemContext`. Marketplace "Request" button replaced with a real navigation link to the slot detail surface. No remaining empty handlers in `components/home/`, `components/dreams/`, or `components/daydream/`.
## 8. v2.0.0 — Completed alignment work (2026-03-25)

All prior alignment priorities are now closed:
1. ✅ Spec names are primary everywhere in docs and UI copy.
2. ✅ Legacy widget naming absorbed into Dreams naming; v1-ui layer archived.
3. ✅ EditProfileDream → ViewProfile projection boundaries clean.
4. ✅ All legacy routes either repurposed or redirected to canonical surfaces.
5. ✅ v1-ui CSS removed from global layout; Dream Rail (v2) CSS in `styles/home-dream.css`.
6. ✅ `PRODUCT_VERSION = '2.0.0'` declared in `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts`.

## 9. Phase 7 — Product Identity, Naming, and Constitution

| Item | Status | Repo truth |
|---|---|---|
| Product definition document | ✅ | `docs/PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md` — locked final authority on what DREAMengin is and is not. |
| Naming authority document | ✅ | `docs/NAMING_AUTHORITY.md` — locked canonical names, rejection list, validation rules, AI agent reference. |
| Product constitution document | ✅ | `docs/CONSTITUTION.md` — locked binding rules covering privacy, action honesty, user intent, navigation, anti-patterns, and valid proposals. |
| Machine-readable naming library | ✅ | `engine/identity/canonical-names.ts` — TypeScript exports for all canonical names and validation functions. |
| Naming authority tests | ✅ | `tests/phase7-naming.test.ts` — programmatic validation of naming authority rules. |
